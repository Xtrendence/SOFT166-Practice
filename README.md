# SOFT166-Practice

Practice element of the SOFT166 module. A Tic-Tac-Toe game using Philips Hue smart bulbs.
 
### What is this?
 
I call it Tic-Tac-Hue. It's a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that uses Philips Hue smart bulbs through the Hue API, along with jQuery AJAX requests to function.

### Does it have copyrighted content?

No. The code's written by myself, with the exception of jQuery itself of course, and the favicon is also a custom one I made using Photoshop and an icon glyph from Font Awesome, which is completely royalty free for both personal and commercial use. It also contains SVG paths derived from Font Awesome.

### Notice

This was made as part of a university assignment. For a more complex example of my coding, please see other projects such as [X:/Anonymous](https://github.com/Xtrendence/X-Anonymous).
