# SOFT166-Practice

Practice element of the SOFT166 module. A Tic-Tac-Toe game using Philips Hue smart bulbs.

---
 
### What is this?
 
I call it Tic-Tac-Hue. It's a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that uses Philips Hue smart bulbs through the Hue API, along with jQuery AJAX requests to function.

### Can I see it in action?

Yes. You can watch a [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz5zgUV4DGo) of it, or you can download it and use it yourself.

### Does it have copyrighted content?

No. The code's written by myself, with the exception of [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) itself of course, and the favicon is also a custom one I made using Photoshop and an icon glyph from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), which is completely royalty free for both personal and commercial use. It also contains SVG paths derived from Font Awesome that are used for the UI.

### Credits

jQuery: https://jquery.com/

Font Awesome: https://fontawesome.com/

### Notice

This was made as part of a university assignment. For a more complex example of my coding, please see other projects such as [X:/Anonymous](https://github.com/Xtrendence/X-Anonymous) or [X:/OS](https://github.com/Xtrendence/X-OS).
